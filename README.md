# Sports Team Salary Manager

## Summary

This project is a system for tracking players payroll information on a sports team. It lets users specify a sport and 
enter information (personal and payroll information) about the players on their team. It will allow different sports
such as hockey, basketball, etc and will allow users to display information about player contracts and salary cap hits. 
The target audience for this system is sports team managers looking for a tool to keep track of their teams payroll and
player information. 

This project is of interest to me because I love to both play and watch sports. I am also interested in the management
of sports and how teams manage their budget when signing players to new contracts or extensions. Developing this project
will allow me to further explore the management of sports teams and the information that sports team managers would find
most important in a tool like this.
